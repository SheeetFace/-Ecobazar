    { type: "paragraph", text: "Ready for the absolute BEST way to make this healthy green veggie taste incredible? Roasted broccoli. Alex and I whipped this up the other day, and the florets were as irresistible as french fries (maybe more so!). Roasting broccoli makes it come out tender and charred, with a mild , almost sweet flavor. Combine that with garlic and a few spritzes of fresh lemon juice, and wow! The flavor pops in a way you’d never imagine possible with this humble vegetable. Our 3 year old Larson kept asking, “Can I have more broccoli?” We 100% promise you’ll fall head over heels for this one." },
