        "description": "Raspberries are bright red, with a hollow core and round shape. They have a fresh sweetness to them, but their tartness undertone makes their sweetness subtler than a strawberry. They also have a floral note which helps sedate the sweetness. They are delicious when you eat them straight or toss them into oatmeal, salads, yoghurt or smoothies. They're good source of dietary fibre and vitamin C with some vitamins A, B, B2, calcium, phosphorus magnesium and iron."
